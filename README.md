**Blogtracer** is a "social content platform" project that aims to subscriber groups, content creators and creator's contents to interact with each other in line with defined quality standards.

It is being developed to address the "search engine optimization" audience access (indexing, ranking) and interaction issues that internet users are predicted to experience due to the development - dissemination of network protocol P2P and decentralized systems used to share data between two or more users.
